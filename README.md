# Event Organisation Guide

__The current (2019-07-24 onwards) and supported version of the Event Organisation Guide (EOG) is now live at https://event-organisation-guide.readthedocs.io__

The GitHub pages version at https://softwaresaved.github.io/event-organisation-guide/ is no longer under active development.

updates of the repo - https://github.com/softwaresaved/event-organisation-guide.git will be active now under the _master_ branch. 

There wil be no active development under the _gh_pages_ branch

## Reasons
GitHub pages suites building static pages but is less suited for documentation, systems such as Sphinx used at Read the Docs support table of content creation, forward and backward links - and do this in a standard way that allow anyone else who has used Spinx for documentation to contribute to the project. We wanted to focus on content for the EOG and not building and maintaining liquid templates and implementing table of contents or search etc. This is why we moved to Sphinx and Read the Docs for hosting.
