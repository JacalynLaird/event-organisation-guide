Event Roles
===========

There are certain roles
(see `examples roles <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fB8Vmsim3SjTc8XKOb47ewxv9ielplWxxSC0vm6EOYo/edit>`_)
that are needed before the event and certain roles during the event and some roles after the event. These roles can vary
depending on the balance of the events and some of the roles naturally go together. It should be noted that one has to
be careful with the role allocation as some combination of roles might be incompatible with taking part in events in an
engageable way or require local knowledge or skills so only be suitable for certain types of individual.

A Duties Roster
***************

It is essential for a medium sized event up to put together a duties roster
(see `example roster <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DLPmYIAJRo35xdereg5XxFa-mbIwI3aNDsr-y3Im6no/edit#>`_
before the event so those assigned different roles know what they need to be doing at different times; this scheduling
decreases problems with communication as itâ€™s transparent what different team members are committed to do at different
times. One of the duties that is usually forgot is registration and reception.

For the EL they there maybe assumptions about who should be included in the roster. For example for CW as the premier
event of the Institute all staff are expected to attend and play a role so they expect some duties. Where this is not
the case doing a call out to the organisation or even asking local contact for volunteers maybe the right way to go.
PhD students helping at events has a long tradition (it might be worth presenting them with a gift for their efforts at
the end of the workshop).
