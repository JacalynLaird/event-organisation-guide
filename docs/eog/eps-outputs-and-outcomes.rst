Outputs and Outcomes Plan
=========================
Outputs
*******
This should be re-visited to put in place what you will make available and what you wonâ€™t.  E.g. for a CW type of event this could include:

* **Presentations**

  * From keynotes (slides, videos)
  * From lightning talks  (slides, videos)
  * From mini-workshops (slides)

* **Speed blogs**

  * From discussion sessions

* **Collaborative ideas**

  * Make the final ideas available

* **Hackday**

  * Information about entries and winners
  * Team/Project name
  * Presentations
  * Links to the software/output

Outcomes
********
The tend to match to met objectives but the EL should decide if a report or analysis of the workshop outputs for themes might allow e.g. change of mindset to be detected.
Feedback results can also be part of this. Longer term analysis (e.g. surveys after the event may also useful to see if the workshop has e.g. changed practice or led to
further collaborations). See the `Ten simple rules for measuring the impact of workshops <https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006191>`_
for more ideas and guidance.
