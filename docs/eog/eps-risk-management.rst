Risk Management
===============
Risks are events that could have a negative impact on the project. Risk management (or risk analysis) is the process of
identifying and assessing a potential risk and the evaluation of the potential impact of the risk. Every risk assessment
should be followed by a risk mitigation plan - actions designed to eliminate or minimise the impact of the identified
risk.

Risk assessment
****************
Typically, risks are assessed against 2 criteria - the severity of the impact they have on your event and
probability of them happening. You then place the risks on the matrix such as the one below, and classify them into
several categories, for example:

    * low risk - the risk is acceptable; it is OK to proceed with the event planning but keep an eye on the risk
    * medium risk - the risk needs to be addressed and mitigation strategy put in place
    * high risk - the risk is critical; you might have to rethink if the event should go ahead

You can decide where to draw the boundaries between the risk categories. It is also OK to classify your risks into more
fine-grained categories, e.g. low, medium, high, extreme - based on your
individual risk assessment. For example, consider the following risk assessment matrix (obtained from `Wikipedia

For events such as the CW or CC, we typically look at the following risk aspects:

    * The main stakeholder (the Software Sustainability Institute)
    * Other stakeholders (sponsors, keynote speakers, attendees, session leaders, organising committee, volunteers/helpers at the event)
    * Budget
    * Event agenda
    * Venue
    * Catering
    * Communication (with various stakeholders)
    * Policies, guidelines and documentation

Risks can also happen at different times in the planning process - before, during and after the event, and may require
different strategies at different stages. See `an example risk assessment

Risk mitigation plan
********************

Based on each individual identified risk from the risk assessment - you need to put a strategy in place to prepare for
and lessen the effects of risks if they occur.
