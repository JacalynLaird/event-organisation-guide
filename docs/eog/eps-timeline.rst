Timeline
========
Itâ€™s important to think about a timeline for the project as soon as it has been confirmed. An outline draft and a deeper
draft at the IES and FS stages would be useful but one should not get bogged down in detail.

In the EPS, a detailed timeline will be needed and should be revised and updated as the project goes on to reflect
changes.

An `example timeline <https://docs.google.com/document/d/115uMkRsuWD-TR_54tG4MkPAS860uzBOebeUenVHeMc8/edit#>`_ is
available to give a holistic view of some of the considerations in this area.
