Venue
=====

Venue is one of the most important aspects of the event and can really make a difference between a good and an
excellent event. It is also the most expensive line in your :doc:`eps-budget`. If financially possible, you should take
an advantage of outsourcing many of your tasks to a professional
venue/event hosting business. They can look after many aspects of your event - menu options and catering,
room layout arrangements, A/V equipment and technical support, cleaning after breaks, hosting a conference dinner, etc.

You can have a look in more detail at various venue
requirements you should consider in `our example venue
requirements template document <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BJsjr4Y-cTBeEEjV5A_VVQ2hZIPsgBivhpin8gLJyb4/edit>`_
and adjust it based on your own capacity and programme needs. Remember that not a single
venue will satisfy all your needs and you will have to prioritise your requirements in terms what is a must, what would
really help and what is optional for your particular event instance. Here we outline various aspects of venue
