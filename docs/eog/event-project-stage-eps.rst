Event Project Stage (EPS)
=========================

The idea was accepted and the constraints and practicalities have been signed off. Now we are in the Event Project Stage (EPS) - itâ€™s time to organise the event itself.

The EL needs to think about infrastructure, set a timeline, which committees and roles there will be in the run up to the event, the details of the agenda, publicity, how to go about attracting sponsorship, catering, event roles on the day and even how to close down the event.

The following sections go into details on these various themes in more detail and give advice on how these elements of the project should be developed.
