### Agenda
The EL should consider the goals and objectives, and the duration of the event to decide the agenda and details such as the type and durations of particular session types. The agenda and reasoning around balance of timings and session types should then be discussed with the steering committee (or equivalent) for comment.

The EL may consider the following types of sessions:

* Informing (e.g. Keynotes)
* Exploring (e.g. Discussion sessions)
* Creating (e.g. Hackdays/Bring Your Own Data(BYOD))
* Learning (e.g. Software or Data Carpentry (SWC/DC) or other instructive approaches)
* Networking (e.g. lunch/coffee and other sessions)

#### Informing
This includes sessions that inform and inspire:
* Keynotes
* Short talks
* Lightning talks
* Allowing ad hoc presentations (e.g. additional lightning talks)

#### Exploring
This includes sessions that aid people working together to explore solutions or identify problems:
* Collaborative ideas or Hackday ideas sessions
* Discussion sessions & speed blogging
* Q & A Panels

#### Creating
This includes building things together:
* Hack days
* Bring your own data sessions
* Paper/Standards generation

#### Teaching
 This includes pedagogical sessions:
* Teaching sessions

#### Networking
This includes sessions for building relationships and connection between people:
* Around food (e.g. lunch/coffee, conference/workshop dinner, lunch)
  * Protecting these times is important to allow networking to take place

    * At the end of the day or first thing in the morning can be a good time for these to be scheduled
