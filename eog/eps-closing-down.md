title: Closing Down The EPS

Just because the event is over does not mean the event is done. Closing down the EPS is still part of the EPS and it requires effort and planning - it can sometimes not be seen as ‘glamorous’ but it’s certainly important for organisational reputation and following up on commitments, promises and making resources available.

### At the end of the event
At the end of an event if there are activities which need any action from those who are participating in the event then they should be made aware of this e.g. that you will be gathering feedback or following up with them about speed blogs.

Also if you are aware of other events and/or a follow on event then making people who are attending aware of these will help meet the wider goals and objectives of your organisation.

A final thanks to sponsors should also be made.

### After the event
Soon after the event there are a number of tasks that can be done straight away and some tasks which might take a bit more time to complete. 

If the EL collects feedback then feedback forms should be ready to send the next working day after the event - the danger of leaving this for longer than a week is that people will start to forget what happened as they get back to their normal routine. Ideally, the email asking for feedback with a link to the feedback form will be ready before the start of the event. 

For larger events the EL may solicit blog posts about people experiences at the event this request should also be made in the week following the event.

If a report is needed that summarises what happened at the events, this can be quite time consuming to produce and it’s worth thinking about which type of report you want e.g. a paper on major themes, an event report that has a ‘being there’ style or a summary of resources produced and available from the event. From experience is can take 1-4 months after an event like CW in elapsed time to produce such a report as it’s dependent on reviewing what happened and other resources being made available.

If resources such as presentations, video recordings, speed blogs, outputs from a Hackday are going to made available then these need to be done and the resources and time found to do them. From experience it can be quite time consuming to prepare video which may include watching, editing, adding a cover, upload (e.g. to YouTube) and updating pages. You also have to decide when to publicise the material (e.g. as they are made available or when they are all ready) this should be part of your publicity plan.

### When are you done
When all of the output you planned to produce and make available are now available you can consider the output side of the event done.

For outcomes, longer term changes you want to track - you may do a longer term survey of those who attended your events e.g. after 6 months or a year to see what impact it had.
If this is all you planned for then the event is done.

It is possible that page hits, resource usage, and citation of the report might feed into tracking wider organisational impact and those charged with this should be made aware of these resources.
