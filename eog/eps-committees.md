Committees are great ways for getting help with shaping the eventâ€™s programme and helping with logistics while giving people credit for taking parts. 

As an example for the CW series there have been two committees which have offered different types of help and advice.

* A Steering/Programme committee
  * For help on the agenda
  * Direction of the workshop
  * Publicity contacts
  * Keynote possibilities
  * Ideas for sponsors
  * Review of contributions or managing reviews of contributions if you have a different set of reviewers (e.g. for Mini workshops in the case of CW).
* An organising committee
  * Focused on logistics (e.g. who will serve the special meals)
  * Identifying roles at the event (e.g. social media event amplifier)

Different types and sizes of workshops will need different committees and roles and responsibilities.

The EL should decide what type, number, size and complexity of committees they need for the workshop.

There is useful guidance available for larger conferences and committee roles published by the [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/organizers/roles-responsibilities.html). For training focused workshops the [Carpentries offer some advice](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/index.html). The Research Software Engineers annual conference attracts 300+ attendees and some excellent information on the place of [committees in the conference](https://rse.ac.uk/conf2019/) and [details of what committee roles entail](https://rse.ac.uk/conf2019/get-involved/) that can be drawn upon.

Once the EL decides on the committees, they should recruit members to the roles - they may do this by using some special status (e.g. suitable contacts, sponsors who are willing for the steering committee and local contact who can help with logistics for the organising committee) or they could use a system where people volunteer and a lightweight system of assessment before they are co-opted.  

Once committees are organised on has to think of how many meetings and what duration they should be help. Each meeting should have some standing items, some key items to resolve and actions points from previous meetings if applicable.
