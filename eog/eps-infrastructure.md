There are a number of different systems which are useful for organising events which an EL may want to make use of.

For event registration the [Eventbrite system](https://www.eventbrite.com/) is very useful; there is a fee for paid for events (that’s how the system is supported), for free events there is no fee. You can add custom questions, export registrations to another system e.g. [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive) Sheets (or Excel, LibreOffice Calc) to help see how people have answered questions about participation or diet to help with further planning. It has an integrated email system so reminders can be sent to people before they attend e.g. what they should bring along (e.g. laptops). In terms of payment there is also an option to allow invoices but extra effort is needed to keep track of these and chase these up with reminders as well as raising invoices at the organisational side so it can add to overheads but can be essential for allowing certain groups to attend.

The Institute has its own website ([www.software.ac.uk](https://www.software.ac.uk)) which runs on the [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) content management system. Although information can be placed on the Eventbrite system putting information about the agenda, accomodation options, guidance and other matters relating to the event is better on a dedicated website. GitHub, via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) allows the ability to setup a website and maybe useful for setting up an adhoc event where access to existing website infrastructure or content management system is not available.

If your organisation has a list of people who have signed up to hear news or don’t mind being contacted from previous events or has a list of email addresses of mailing-lists  where people who are interested or maybe interested in your events then an excellent system to use for promoting to them could be an email marketing system. An example of this is the [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/) system which allows the creation of named lists of email addresses and scheduled mailshots amongst other features (e.g. [integration with Eventbrite](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jF478TeevvO9BMRIIKTQYEmzIaec10dLuypTtNAxq4U/edit#)). Sometimes the personal touch maybe better and a named person emailing to a list maybe more effective. 

In terms of contacting sponsors the personal touch is better and a person emailing them rather than a list will be better. Those responsible for first contact with potential sponsors can be different than those who take over the conversation if sponsors show interest.

Other examples of tools used to help organising are those that help support scheduling e.g. for talk orders or reviewers or collaboration groups where certain constraint combinations e.g. role, gender, domain or career stage are used. Doing this by hand fully could be tedious so Python libraries for handling data such as [Pandas and linear modelling libraries such as PuLP](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2017-12-18-assigning-fellowship-programme-2018-applications-reviewers) could be helpful to create an initial configuration of people which you can then manually tweak, saving a lot of time.
