Sponsorship for events is becoming more important to help make them affordable but also we are attracting more sponsors to events allowing the events to, e.g. pay for a student to attend or support the attendance of speakers or people outside of the normal remit (e.g. legal staff). This also attracts people to the event and raises the profile of the sponsoring organisations. It can also enrich the experience of those attending by offering free t-shirts, licences or even hardware.

One has to to be careful with sponsorship â€“ the balance between in-kind and actual cash is important. Sometimes in-kind sponsorship can help enrich the programme but it does not help bottom line on your budget.

The EL should use the goals and themes of the workshop to identify which companies might be interested in sponsoring your event.

Create a sponsorship set of packages (e.g. the traditional Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) but also allow for ad hoc sponsorship and be clear about what advantages (e.g. presence on all organiser intro slides) or influence sponsors will have (e.g. a talking slot). This will  make it easier to approach sponsors.

As mentioned in the section on Infrastructure a plan and people need to be assigned the task of attracting sponsorship. The first contact from the Institute or event can be different then people (e.g. the EL) who takes on the conversation with those who are interested in supporting the event.
