It’s important to think about the timeline of the project as soon as it’s been confirmed. An outline draft and a deeper draft at the IES and FS stages would be useful but one should not get bogged down in detail. 

In the EPS a detailed timeline will be needed and should be revised and updated as the project goes on to reflect changes. 

An [example timeline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/115uMkRsuWD-TR_54tG4MkPAS860uzBOebeUenVHeMc8/edit#) is available to give a holistic view of some of the considerations in this area.
