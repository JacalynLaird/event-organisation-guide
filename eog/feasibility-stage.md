## Feasibility Stage (FS)
The _Feasibility Stage_ (FS) comes after the IES stage is signed off by any necessary stakeholders and now the event idea is being explored more thoroughly. The FS is akin to a pre-planning or early planning stage. At this stage various things are needed before formal sign-off and to the _Event Project Stage_ (EPS) (i.e. before the Institute agrees to take on the staff effort, financial risk and opportunities afforded by running the event).

This is a list of information from the FS stage which is needed for evaluation by stakeholders. Successful evaluation will move us into the EPS stage:

* Goals & Objectives
  * I.e. What we hope to achieve (goals) and a set of measurable steps towards achieving our goals (objectives).
* The audience
  * Which categories of people you are planning the events for helps set the goals and objectives in context.
  * E.g. Career stage, geographic location, gender, ethnicity, job roles, organisation types (e.g. funders, publishers, researchers, administrators) should be given some detail.
  * Prioritising the audience might also help with refining goals and keeping planning on target. If the priority changes then this should be reflected in the goals/objectives. 
    * Although if this does happen then the _Lead Stakeholder_ should probably be consulted to make sure itâ€™s ok to carry on if you are in the EPS stage.
