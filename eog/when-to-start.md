title: When To Start Planning for An Event

For events such as a Collaborations Workshop it’s important that the idea and feasibility stages start early, anywhere from 9-12 months before the event, to allow promotion, calls for sponsorship, registration, calls for participation and to get this into your target audience’s diaries early before other events are announced. 

For smaller events or workshops, e.g. Software and Data Carpentry, 3-6 months are normally enough.

For online webinar type events, 1-2 months is enough time.
